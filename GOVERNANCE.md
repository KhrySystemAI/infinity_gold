# Project Governance

## Purpose

This document describes how the project is governed, including decision-making processes, roles, and responsibilities. It is intended to ensure the project can continue reliably, even in the absence of any single contributor.

---

## Governance Model

* The project follows a **meritocratic governance model**: contributors earn influence through consistent, high-quality contributions.
* Key decisions are made by the **core team**, which consists of individuals who have demonstrated long-term commitment and deep understanding of the project.
* Decisions on major features, breaking changes, or security policies require **consensus** from the core team.

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role              | Responsibilities                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Team**     | Oversees project direction, approves major contributions, merges pull requests for major changes.                 |
| **Maintainers**   | Manage day-to-day operations, review and merge contributions, monitor CI/CD and automated tests, handle releases. |
| **Contributors**  | Submit code, documentation, tests, and bug reports following contribution guidelines.                             |
| **Security Team** | Handles vulnerability reports, security audits, and ensures compliance with security best practices.              |

---

## Decision Making

* **Minor changes** (typo fixes, small improvements) can be merged by maintainers after review.
* **Major changes** (new features, architecture modifications) must be reviewed and approved by at least two core team members.
* **Emergency patches** may be applied immediately by the security team with post-facto approval by core team members.

---

## Contribution Process

* Contributions are accepted via pull requests following the `CONTRIBUTING.md` guidelines.
* All code must pass automated tests, linters, and code style checks before being merged.
* Significant contributions should be accompanied by tests, documentation, and, if applicable, security considerations.

---

## Continuity and Succession

* The project maintains **redundancy for critical roles** (e.g., multiple members of the core team).
* Access credentials, deployment keys, and necessary administrative rights are **shared among trusted team members** in a secure manner.
* In the event a core member is unavailable, remaining members can continue development, release new versions, and handle security issues without delay.

---

## Communication

* All decisions, discussions, and proposals are documented in the **public issue tracker**.
* Team meetings are optional but recommended for discussing strategic plans or urgent issues.

---

## Review and Updates

* This governance document is reviewed **annually** or after significant changes in the project structure.
* Updates must be approved by the core team and documented in the repositoryâ€™s change log.
